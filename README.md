# Python-Mini-Projects: Python Programming Challenges

This repository is a collection of **simple but challenging** Python scripts and projects designed to practice and showcase my skills in the language. Each project focuses on solving a specific problem efficiently and with **good programming practices**.

The goal is to build a portfolio of projects that not only work but are also **readable, well-structured, and robust**.

### What you'll find here:

* **Well-documented projects:** Each script includes clear comments explaining the logic, purpose, and design decisions.
* **Focus on efficiency:** Optimal algorithms are prioritized to solve problems, demonstrating an understanding of time complexity and performance.
* **Error handling and validation:** Scripts are built to handle invalid user input and errors in a controlled and professional manner.

This repository serves as a sample of my ability to turn programming problems into clean and efficient solutions.
